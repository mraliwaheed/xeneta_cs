first time load all data from raw,staging and final
2 when new data comes only run incremental model, this will add all new  data and on final step creating a final table we can check the requiremnt in query where you only want to see that 
In particular: _we should only show aggregated price values if we have at least 5 different companies and 2 different suppliers providing data on the given lane, with given equipment type_ .

----------------------
i also want to keep the file name for future back tracking and datetime column of imported
